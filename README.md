## Welcome to Hour of Code

## Tutorials

Note: For those without a laptop, we have an "unplugged" series of tutorials for you.

Open up browser and go to code.org, then click orange 'Start' button. The page is organized with the most popular ones at the top. We suggest starting with either Angry Birds or Frozen.

If you want to type code from a real-world programming language, give Javascript or Python try:

## After finishing your first tutorial

We're guessing you'll love the first tutorial so much you'll want to try another! Feel free to stick around to try another tutorial on that page. You can also click on the "Beyond One Hour" tab, where you'll find even more tutorials, like how to make games and web pages, program robots, or even university-level courses.

Before you head out, come to us so we can hand you your Certificate of Completion!
