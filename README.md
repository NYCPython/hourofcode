## Beyond One Hour of Code

We're happy that you've begun your exciting exploration into the fun and limitless world of programming! 

We hope that you'll also want to spread the joy of [Hour of Code](http://nycpython.github.io/hourofcode) with your friends and family.

In addition to the [Beyond One Hour](http://code.org/learn/beyond) exercises on the code.org site, we've collected the additional tips and resources that we wanted to share with you:

* Encouragement from mentors
* What can you do with coding?
* Free in-person resources
* Programming Courses

### Encouragement from Mentors

We've asked the mentors from Saturday's Hour of Code for advice or words of encouragement. Here's what they had to say:

    “Keep going! Look for tasks that you perform on your computer 
    that are ripe for automation, and use your programming skills 
    to dispense with them for good.”

            “If you had fun, keep at it. I started out making little games 
            on my family's computer, and over 15 years later, I still 
            enjoy it.“

    “Pick something simple to build and use that as a focal point 
    for learning rather than trying to learn a language and then 
    build something with it.”

            “Programming can be a really rewarding experience, and there's 
            no limit to what you can do with it.”
